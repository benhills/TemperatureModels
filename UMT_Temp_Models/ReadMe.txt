These are simple temperature models that were developed at the University of Montana as a part of my M.S. thesis. Included are a few scripts from two separate projects. 

- A near-surface temperature model that is meant to simulate heat transfer in the upper ~20m of the Greenland ice sheet ablation zone. This model is used to analyze data from 20m temperature strings installed in SW Greenland.

- Two simple 'full-thickness' models for ~1000m thick ice in the ablation zone of Greenland. Again, these models are used alongside some temperature profiles gathered in this area. In this case the temperature profiles extend to the bed of the ice sheet.
